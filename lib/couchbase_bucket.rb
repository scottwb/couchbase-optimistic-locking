    # IMPORTANT:
    #   This method assumes that the doc you pass in is unmodified.
    #   Any unsaved changes to it will be discarded.
    #
    #   It loads a clean copy of the doc and passes it to the given
    #   block, which should apply changes to that document that can
    #   be retried from scratch multiple times until they are successful.
    #
    #   This method will return the final state of the saved doc.
    #   The caller should use this afterward, instead of the object it has
    #   passed in to the method call.
